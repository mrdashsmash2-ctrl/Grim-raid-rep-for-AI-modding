		<text>I can't believe what you've done for me, stalker! Even some of the neutrals around here are coming to me for upgrades now! But I know, in my heart, I'm not doing as well as I could. If only I had some better tools... Listen, stalker. Bring me some expert-level tools, and I'll be in your debt. I could make your shooter into a masterpiece! I can't upgrade your stuff for free, of course, but I'll think of some way I can return the favour.</text>
